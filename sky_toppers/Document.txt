Project title:
 Helpmewiththemood

project description
A person’s emotions and moods have direct bearings on his/her daily activities. It is necessary to eliminate negative emotions that our family or friends might be experiencing, to help them lead a better life. Research has shown that social networking activity is a good source to gauge a person’s state of mind. Mood of a user is often reflected in his/her social content, like tweets, blogs, article, status updates, etc. Timely analysis of a user’s social media can be used to improve the feelings, and even save a person’s life in an extreme case! The proposed challenge is to know the emotion/mood of a person, to help in eliminating any negative state of mind that might have adverse effect on his/her daily life.
